# EchoMind – Personal Voice Emotion Journal with Auto-Improving AI 
---
### Overview
EchoMind is a privacy-first voice journal where you record voice notes, and an AI (running locally or self-hosted) extracts emotions, topics, and insights, storing them as searchable embeddings. The model re-trains weekly based on your feedback, becoming uniquely yours.
